You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.\nExample:\nInput: \u0026quot;babad\u0026quot;\rOutput: \u0026quot;bab\u0026quot;\rNote: \u0026quot;aba\u0026quot; is also a valid answer.\r Dynamic Programming Algorithm To improve over the brute force solution, we first observe how we can avoid unnecessary re-computation while validating palindromes.\nConsider the case \u0026ldquo;ababa\u0026rdquo;. If we already knew that \u0026ldquo;bab\u0026rdquo; is a palindrome, it is obvious that \u0026ldquo;ababa\u0026rdquo; must be a palindrome since the two left and right end letters are the same.\n$$ P\\left (i,j \\right ) = \\left (P \\left (i+1, j-1 \\right )\\ and\\ \\mathbf S_{i} == \\mathbf S_{j}\\right ) $$\nCode c++:\nclass Solution {\rpublic:\rstring longestPalindrome(string s) {\rif(s.empty()) return \u0026quot;\u0026quot;;\rint n = s.length();\rbool isPalindrome[n][n];\rfill_n(\u0026amp;isPalindrome[0][0],n*n,false);\rint maxLength = 0;\rint startIndex = 0;\rstring result;\rint i, j;\rfor(j=0; j\u0026lt;n; j++){\rfor(i=0; i\u0026lt;=j; i++){\risPalindrome[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j]) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (j-i\u0026lt;=2 || isPalindrome[i+1][j-1] );\rif(isPalindrome[i][j] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; j-i+1 \u0026gt; maxLength){\rmaxLength = j-i+1;\rstartIndex = i;\r}\r}\r}\rresult = s.substr(startIndex, maxLength);\rreturn result;\r}\r};\r  The fill_n() function in C++ STL is used to fill some default values in a container. The fill_n() function is used to fill values upto first n positions from a starting position. It accepts an iterator begin and the number of positions n as arguments and fills the first n position starting from the position pointed by begin with the given value.  void fill_n(iterator begin, int n, type value);\r  In the traversal process, variable j loops in the outer layer, while variable i loops in the inner layer. The reason is as follows.\nFor example, when we want to the value of isPalindrome[2][7], we must know the value of isPalindrome[3][6] and isPalindrome[4][5], which means that we must traverse in the order of variable j.\n  Manacher\u0026rsquo;s Algorithm Algorithm 1\nCode c++:\nReferences and Websites \rManacherâ€™s Algorithm Explainedâ€” Longest Palindromic Substring\rDid you find this page helpful?
