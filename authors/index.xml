      <description>&lt;p&gt;Morphling is a ranged agility hero that has many flexible abilities, item builds and is leveled as a very strong hard carry. He relies strongly on his attributes, and is an effective ganker. Unlike other agility carries that rely on physical attacks, he relies on his powerful abilities to initiate and shift into a state from which he can make a kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waveform lets him surge directly forward to a location, damaging enemies on his path, working both as a nuke or an escape. Adaptive Strike is a scaling two-part ability that blasts enemies with a jet of water, either stunning and knocking back or dealing damage.  (never mindðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ)&lt;/p&gt;
